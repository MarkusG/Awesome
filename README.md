# Preamble

## Adding to this list
To add to this list, use the [example template](#example-item) provided, and add it to table of contents at the top.
next submit a PR and you're all set!

Note you may add new categories if there are multiple items in Miscellaneous that make sense in their own category.

# Unix
*Unix-y programs, tools, or information*

## Floppy's Neovim Config
*Floppy's neovim config, focused on Go, Rust and Elm. 10 times better than isaac's*

[floppy-nvim](https://github.com/nixnest/Awesome/tree/master/Unix/floppy-nvim)

explanation of what the config adds/does would go here.

## Sky's comma scripts (inspired by Brandon Rhodes)

*Some useful scripts, most to simplify git operations*

[sky-bin](https://github.com/nixnest/Awesome/tree/master/Unix/sky-bin)

Rationale behind the comma: https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2009/commands-with-comma/

# Programming
*Javascript not allowed*

# Miscellaneous
*Something that doesn't belong anywhere else*

## Example Item
*Give a short (under 100 character) summary of what this is.*

[Now give a relevant link to what this is](https://example.com/)

Now for the rest of this, you may give a much more indepth explanation or even a tutorial.
